            Welcome to the **Task Manager App**, a tool designed to help you prioritize and organize your tasks based on the
            <strong>"Four Quadrants"</strong> method from **Stephen Covey's** book,
            <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. Covey teaches that **effective time management** is about
            <strong>"putting first things first"</strong>—focusing on tasks that truly matter rather than just reacting to urgency.

            Our app helps users categorize tasks into four quadrants:
            <strong>Important & Urgent, Important but Not Urgent, Not Important but Urgent, and Not Important & Not Urgent</strong>.
            With an intuitive interface, users can **add, edit, update, and delete tasks**, ensuring only active, uncompleted
            tasks remain visible. Whether managing deadlines, planning long-term projects, or organizing daily responsibilities,
            this tool encourages productivity and efficiency. Explore the app and take control of your to-do list today! 🚀
